Here’s what you need to know about the game:  

**The Objective:** The player whose turtle reaches its home first wins the game.

**How to Play:**  

Each player rolls a dice to get a number.  
- The player then moves their turtle by that many steps.  
- The players alternate turns until one of them wins.  

**The Structure:**  

- Each player had a turtle indicated by a different color. You can have more than two players, but for the sake of this tutorial, you’ll be creating a two-player game.
- Each turtle has a home position that it must reach.
- Each player uses a die to choose a value at random for their turn. In your program, the die is represented by a list of numbers from 1 to 6.
